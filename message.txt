Just found the job post and saw that I did not quite fit the requirements, but was really interested in the task itself.

Ready to discuss the mismatches, in case of interest, and there is some info, JFC:

Skilled in building a wide range of web applications, from complex dynamic systems to static landing pages, including embedded browser applications, using modern adaptive layout in accordance with the mobile-first principle.

Thanks, it was fun.
